          Or did the footsteps behind him belong to one of the countless law
          enforcers of this city, and would the steel cuffs snap shut around his
          wrists any moment? He could already hear the command to stop. He
          looked around in panic. Suddenly he spotted the narrow passage.
          Instantly, he turned right and disappeared between the two buildings.

          He tried to feel his way through the darkness and froze: apparently,
          there was no other exit from this small courtyard except the passage
          he had entered through. The footsteps grew louder and louder, and he
          saw a dark figure round the corner. Desperately, his eyes searched
          through the night for a way out. Was it really all over now? Were all
          the effort and preparation in vain? He pressed himself tightly against
          the wall behind him and hoped the pursuer wouldn’t see him — when

          Could this be the desperately longed-for escape from his dilemma?
          Slowly, he moved toward the open door, always pressed close to the

          this narrow alley in the infamous harbor district? Right now, when he
          had pulled off the job of a lifetime and was ready to escape with the

          and waited to snatch the spoils of his work? Or did the footsteps
          behind him belong to one of the city’s many law enforcers, and would
          the steel cuffs snap shut around his wrists at any moment? He could
          already hear the command to stop. He looked around in panic. Suddenly
